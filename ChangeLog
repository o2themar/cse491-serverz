*For HW 10 I implmented the user login and authentication version 1. I plan to
change this later using the SQLite database. But for now in the image app you
can create a user and login and it will check if the user is already created.
The images are uploaded to the user so they are mapped by user.

*For HW 11 I addded data persistance in sqlite (Project 16). Now images are
stored in the database rather than a dictionary.
