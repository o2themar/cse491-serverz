* For  hw9 I did project 12 and implemented AJAX image upload with JQuery.
* This should automatically be done when you upload an image in the image app.

*For HW 10 I implemented project 2 for a WSGI middleware componenet that does
playback and recording of all WSGI traffic between server and component.

*To use add the -M flag at the end of the argument list for server.py
*For example: python server.py -A image -M

*For HW 10 I implmented the user login and authentication (project 15) version 1. I plan to
change this later using the SQLite database. But for now in the image app you
can create a user and login and it will check if the user is already created.
The images are uploaded to the user so they are mapped by user.

*For HW 11 I addded data persistance in sqlite (Project 16). Now images are
stored in the database rather than a dictionary.

* For HW 11 I tried implementing a commenting system (Project 8) for the images but I was
running into some problems with the database not creating the table.
